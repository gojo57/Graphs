EULER TOUR
--> A tour that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.
--> A graph has an Euler tour if and only if it is connected and every vertex has even degree.
--> For a graph having N vertices and E edges, where E = N-1, total time for the Euler tour will be 2*N-1 or 2*N.

Now some questions arise, eg:
1. Is x an ancestor of y in the tree?
2. Whether y is in subtree of x or not?
3. Whether x comes in path from y to root?

--> If time in of x is less than time in of y and time out of x is greater than time out of y, then x is an ancestor of y.
