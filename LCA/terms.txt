SPARSE TABLE
--> Performs range query int logn
--> Idempotent functions range query in O(1), eg. max in range [l,r], gcd in range [l,r], etc.
--> Idempotent function: Function whose operation results remain unchanged when an operation is applied more than once.
--> Updation is not possible in sparse table.
--> Structure:
    a) 2D array, n*m
    b) n = length of array
    c) m = ceil(logn)+1
    d) mat[i][j] = [i, i+2^j-1], if I start at I the answer for the range [i, i+2^j-1] is stored in mat[i][j]
    e) [i, i+2^j-1] = [i, i+2^(j-1)-1] + [i+2^(j-1), i+2^j-1]
