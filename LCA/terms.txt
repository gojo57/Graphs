SPARSE TABLE
--> Performs range query int logn
--> Idempotent functions range query in O(1), eg. max in range [l,r], gcd in range [l,r], etc.
--> Idempotent function: Function whose operation results remain unchanged when an operation is applied more than once.
--> Updation is not possible in sparse table.
--> Structure:
    a) 2D array, n*m
    b) n = length of array
    c) m = ceil(logn)+1
    d) mat[i][j] = [i, i+2^j-1], if I start at I the answer for the range [i, i+2^j-1] is stored in mat[i][j]
    e) [i, i+2^j-1] = [i, i+2^(j-1)-1] + [i+2^(j-1), i+2^j-1]

BINARY LIFTING:
--> parent[i][j] = 2^jth parent of i
--> parent[i][j] = parent[parent[i][j-1]][j-1]
--> eg, to calculate 13th parent of x, we can calculate 8th parent of x, then 4th parent of 8th parent of x, then 1st parent of 4th parent of 8th parent of x. 
    => 13 = 8 + 4 + 1

TIME IN AND TIME OUT:
--> Time in: When I enter a node
--> Time out: When I exit a node
--> For x to be an ancestor of y, time in[x] <= time in[y] and time out[x] >= time out[y].
